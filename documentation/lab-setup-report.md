# Lab Setup and Tool Verification Report (Task 5)

## 1. Environment Configuration Proof

The lab uses an isolated Host-Only network for safe testing, ensuring the target is not exposed to the public internet.

* **Attacker:** Kali Linux
* **Target:** Metasploitable2
* **Proof:** Both VMs are configured on the same Host-Only network adapter.

**Kali IP Proof:**

**Metasploitable IP Proof:**

## 2. Tool Verification: Nmap (Network Scanning)

**Goal:** Confirm Kali can reach the target and identify open services for exploitation.

**Command:** `nmap [Metasploitable2 IP]`

**Result:** Nmap successfully identified numerous open ports, confirming Metasploitable2 is functioning as a vulnerable target.

## 3. Tool Verification: Wireshark (Packet Capture)

**Goal:** Prove the attacker machine can monitor all traffic within the isolated network.

**Process:** Captured ICMP traffic generated by a `ping` command from Kali to Metasploitable2.

**Proof:** Wireshark successfully isolated the Echo Request and Echo Reply packets.

## 4. Tool Verification: Burp Suite (Web Proxy)

**Goal:** Demonstrate the ability to set up an intercepting proxy for web application testing.

**Process:** Configured Firefox inside Kali to proxy traffic through Burp Suite, then browsed to the Metasploitable2 web server.

**Proof:** Burp Suite successfully intercepted the initial `GET` request destined for the target IP.
